<h1>
Web Flask
</h1>
<p>
This was a sub-project within AirBnB in which I began working with Flask and Jinja2. In this project, I began integrating the back-end storage engine with the web static HTML/CSS pages written earlier.
</p>
<p>
Files 0 - 6 were introductory tasks familiarizing myself with using Flask. Files 7 forward involved gradually putting together more and more complex Jinja templates based on the HBnB HTML pages.
</p>
<p>
The most complete Flask/Jinja app-template combo in this directory is defined in Flask module 100-hbnb.py and Jinja template 100-hbnb.html.
</p>
<p>
To run the Flask app, execute the following command from the root directory of the project:
</p>
<p>
~ $ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost
HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m web_flask.100-hbnb
The app can be accessed at 0.0.0.0:5000/hbnb.
